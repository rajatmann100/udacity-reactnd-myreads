# MyReads Project

MyReads project for Udacity React Nanodegree course.

## :zap: Quickstart

To get started developing right away:

1. Clone this repo using "clone" or download ZIP directly from Github and extract
2. `cd` into project root folder
3. Install project dependencies using command `npm i`
4. Use development server with command `npm start`

Go to app on link 'http://localhost:3000' in browser.
## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
